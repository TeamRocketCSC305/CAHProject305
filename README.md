# CAHProject305

We are programming in Android Studio, which runs on the Java language. This means we will be adhering to the standard Java coding conventions. In general, our code will follow these guidelines:

Class, Variable, Method Name Guidelines:
•	Avoid generic variables names – try to keep variable names specific to the instance where they are used
•	Class names will be formatted as such: ClassName
•	Variable names will be formatted as such: variableName
•	Method names will be formatted as such: methodName or method_Name
•	Constant variables will be formatted as: ALL_UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
•	Variables will always be defined at the top of the block where they are used
•	Variable scope will be limited as much as possible to prevent accidental overlap of instance variables
•	Imported libraries will always appear at the top of the class file

Spacing and Indentation
•	Indentation will be used to isolate blocks of code so the proper form of the logic is visually represented (one indentation when entering a function or loop etc.)
•	White space will be used to separate lines of code which are not directly related to show the nature of their relationship with one another
•	Brackets will be used concisely (limit amount of lines devoted solely to open/closing brackets)


Comments
•	Classes and methods will have headers in the form of JavaDoc comments
•	In-line comments will be placed at the end of the line of code
•	Comments should be used sparingly to avoid overwhelming the reader, but should be descriptive enough to provide a quick overview of the code’s function 


How to Install
1: download and install android studio
2: download and install git
3: open android studio
4: go to preferences>version control>GitHub
5:Enter https://GitHub.com/TeamRocketCSC305/CAHProject305.git for the host, and your own login info for the rest
6: choose "check out project from version control" then "git"
7: enter https://GitHub.com/TeamRocketCSC305/CAHProject305.git as the VCS repository url and hit clone
8: once android studio has finished that process, open the terminal tab on the bottom of android studio, and type "git remote add 305CAH https://GitHub.com/TeamRocketCSC305/CAHProject305.git" and hit enter
9: when you want to update code you have to what is on the GitHub repository, type in "git pull 305CAH"
10: alternatively, to update the repository with changes you have made, type "git push 305CAH"
